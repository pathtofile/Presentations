# eBPF - The coolest-newest kid in town
Presentation given at the `CSides Monthly` Security meetup in July 2021.

## Abstract
Extended Berkeley Packet Filters (eBPF) is quickly becoming the hottest-newest addition to the Linux Kernel.

With its ability to dynamically trace code execution and efficiently route packets, it is quickly becoming the major system to replace software-defined firewalls, routers, and system tracers, thanks to investment by cloud-native giants like Google and Netflix.

This talk will give an overview of eBPF, and how it can be used for everything from packet capturing, to malware analysis, bug hunting, and even malware. eBPF is becoming a must-know system for Linux developers and security specialists, so come along to learn what eBPF is, why I think it's so dope, and how to start making and using eBPF Programs and tools. Also it's coming to Windows (sorta)!
